#### BASICs

I have been programming from a very young age. I started with languages like __BASIC__ and __LOGO__ when I was a kid and I made my way through __C, C++ and Java__. This strong base helped me excel in the work I do. I was hungry to learn more after my Bachelors in Engineering (Computer Science), and therefore I moved to Melbourne to do my Masters in Software Engineering at the __University of Melbourne__.

#### Mobile Apps

I was so passionate about mobile apps that I built my career around it. I've worked in a variety of domains and in a variety of roles in the mobile app space. I've led a range of engineering teams through the course of last __10 years__. From leading a team in a startup to leading a group of high skilled engineering, I take pride in the work I do and also proud of the people I've helped grow and up-skill.

#### Testing & Testability

Working in the testing space for the past 4 years has given me a different perspective to look at code. __Testability__ is something I promote and try to bring into any product I work on. My latest work with __Visual Snapshot Testing__ is something I consider a big milestone in my career.
