#### Virtual Street Tour

When I was working at 13CABS as the lead android developer, I gained so much knowledge on things that can be done with google maps. An idea that came during that period was to use the platform to take you from point A to point B on a map, but using Google Street View. 

Virtual Street Tour is the amalgamation of that concept.
