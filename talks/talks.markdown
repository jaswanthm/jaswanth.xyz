I will be talking about implementing CI with mobile in mind. Here is a short abstract 

> Setting up CI/CD itself is a challenging task, especially if you are starting from scratch. Implementing one for mobile apps has its own complications like signing the apps and running tests on devices/simulators. In this talk, I will talk about the best way to set up mobile app build pipelines from scratch. In order to view an end-to-end example, I will show how to build an android and iOS app pipeline of the SwagLabs react native app.
