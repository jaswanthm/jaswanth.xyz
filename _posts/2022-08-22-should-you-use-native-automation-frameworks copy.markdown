### k6 Champion!

I am not someone who get too close to a tool. I believe strongly that problem always comes first. And I continue to believe so. 

Sometimes you just end up using a few tools in your daily life so much that you develop a liking for it. Two such tools that I am currently working on are k6 and pactflow.io. 

Recently I became a k6 champion, given I've already been sharing my experience with k6 lately. I've used their API performance testing tool and the xk6-kafka extension. Both which I've been working on quite closely, and also contributing to their opensource repos. 

I recently also spoke about testing async systems using k6, pactflow and other tools. Check it out in the [events page]({% link events.md %})
