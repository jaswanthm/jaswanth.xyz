I am not someone who gets too close to a tool. The problem always comes first. And I continue to believe so. 

Sometimes you just use a few tools in your daily life so much that you develop a liking for them. Two such tools that I am currently working on are k6 and pactflow.io. 

Recently I became a k6 champion, given I've already been sharing my experience with k6 lately. I've used its API performance testing tool and the xk6-kafka extension. Both of which I've been working on quite closely and also contributing to their open-source repos. 

I recently also spoke about testing async systems using k6, pactflow and other tools. Check it out in the [events page](/events)
