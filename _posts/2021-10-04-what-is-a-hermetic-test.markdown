### What is hermetic test ?

## Meaning 

Hermetic 

/həːˈmɛtɪk/

complete and airtight.

<!--more-->

## In testing context

An isolated test where the state of the app is completely set @before the test is run.

## An obsession

Have you ever been obsessed with a pattern or a concept that you spend years working toward it. That is what hermetic tests are for me. 

I first heard about it when Kel mentioned it to me and sent me an article on hermetic tests. The slack engineering blog spoke about how they built their whole test automation framework and their test data based on the hermetic test pattern.

## What is it about ?

I just recorded a talk about hermetic UI tests and how I managed to implement it for our test frameworks. You can catch it at Ministry of Testing's Test.bash() 2021.
