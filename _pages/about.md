I’m Jas from Melbourne. I currently work at Culture Amp as a Lead Quality Coach, specialising in test automation and testability. 

I have worked in the mobile app development space for almost a decade, where I saw mobile devices and operating systems get better and better by the day. My fascination towards mobile devices made me start my professional career as a mobile app developer. But my quest to build better apps and write code that is much more testable lead me to transition into a test automation engineer specialising in mobile. 

Since then, I’ve gradually explored a wide variety of test automation frameworks and have consulted for some of the leading mobile app teams in Australia to build efficient test automation suites for mobile apps. 

I have spoken about my mobile test automation journey in a variety of testing conferences like the Ministry of Testing’s Testbash and Saucelabs’ Saucecon. 

I now work at Culture Amp alongside the legendary Anne-Marie Charrett helping build a passionate quality enablement team.

I currently work with test automation frameworks (functionality, contract and load) for APIs, microservices and event sourcing systems. 

Latest obsession… Observability within test frameworks.
